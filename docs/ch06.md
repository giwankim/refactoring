# 6. A First Set of Refactorings

## 6.11 Split Phase

### Motivation

When I run into code that's dealing with two different things, I look for a way to split it into separate modules.

One of the ways to do a split like this is to divide the behavior into two sequential phases.

### Mechanics

- Extract the second phase code into its own function.
- Test.
