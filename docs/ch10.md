# 10. Simplifying Conditional Logic

_Introduce Special Case_ 경우 자바로 씌여진 1판을 참고했다.

Apply _Decompose Conditional_ to complicated conditionals, and use _Consolidate Conditional Expression_ to make logical
combinations clearer. _Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses_ to clarify cases where I want to run some
pre-checks before my main processing. If I see several conditions using the same switching logic, _Replace Conditional
with Polymorphism_.

A lot of conditionals are used to handle special cases, such as null; _Introduce Special Case_ can remove a lot of
duplicate code. To remove conditions, but communicate (and check) a program's state, _Introduce Assertion_.

Finally, _Replace Control Flag with Break_ can simplify loops with control flags.
