## Replace Magic Literal

### Motivation

Magic literals are common literal values that appear in the source code.

Usually, the best thing to do is replace the value with a constant named after its meaning.

### Mechanics

- Declare a constant and set it to the magic literal.
- Search for all appearances of the literal.
- For each, see if its use matches the meaning of the new constant. If so, replace it with the new constant and test.

Once done, a good way to check is to change the value of the constant and see if the tests fully reflect this change.
